            <p>Last year we witnessed two devastating realities in the United States: 47,173 Americans had killed themselves; the firearm death rate hit a 20-year high after 39,773 people died from guns. Behind the two tragic numbers, we may realize that firearm suicide, the grey area that often lacks press attention, accounts for a substantial proportion of the violence epidemic. </p>

            <h4> About the Project</h4>
            <p>Modern online news organizations collect various data points from their audience. However, aside from feed and advertisement recommendations, most organizations don’t fully leverage personalization as a tool for news dissemination. As readers generate increasing information through their news consumption, we are exploring the possibilities for use of reader characteristics in personalized news stories.</p>

            <p>To demonstrate how to establish news personalization, we created and iterated a story prototype. On the prototyping webpage, we stimulate one possible user experience.</p>


            <p>So, what exactly is news personalization? News personalization is the act of automatically adapting news articles based on the person or population viewing them. Personalization can close gaps between readers around the world created by distance. It can inspire curiosity in readers with a novel form of storytelling. It can increase both engagement and retention of readers, making it useful — and potentially critical — for web-based news outlets vying for survival in a competitive market.</p>

            <p>Our form of news personalization is unbiased and impartial, while making sure readers receive content that informs them and enriches their lives in an engaging way. We also only utilize information that readers knowingly give the site or other connected apps permission to view. However, we understand that news personalization can sound Ex-Machina scary, so scroll down to see "<i>the ethical considerations Q&A</i>" we’ve deliberated to ensure that news personalization delivers unbiased content.</p>

            <h4> Ethical Considerations for News Personalization</h4>
            <p><em>Q: How do we implement news personalization that informs without hardening the information bubble in which most modern readers already live?</em></p>

            <p>We understand that in this day and age, it can be incredibly difficult to understand a point of view with which we do not agree. On our social media websites, we follow what we are interested in and agree with and are subsequently pushed content that matches that. Even the news articles we see each day are chosen and sorted for us based on those preferences.</p>
            <p>Our project avoids that type of personalization. We do not take into account readers’ political leanings and we do not simply show content with which readers already agree. Our goal is to leave readers more informed about the world and more open to new ideas.</p>

            <p><em>Q: How does news personalization differ between reported stories and opinion pieces?</em></p>

            <p>When personalizing reporting, we focus on reach. We want to make sure the reporting reaches and engages those who might be the most interested or most affected by it. Opinion pieces may have biases embedded in them from the writer, but news personalization does not intend to emphasize or de-emphasize those biases.</p>

            <p><em>Q: Have you considered how emphasizing certain information might harm certain populations? For example, is it safe to show more information about the causes of suicide to a population that is more likely to have suicidal thoughts (based on age, location, gender, etc.)? If not, how do you handle this?</em></p>

            <p>We, of course, would never intend to cause any further harm to any population. In cases like this, we ask that local organizations use their discretion and focus more on encouraging help-seeking and avoiding sensationalization that could lead to further harm.</p>

            <p><em>Q: How might personalized news negatively sway public opinion on a topic?</em></p>

            <p>While we are influenced heavily by the things we see on the internet, that influence is more likely to entrench us deeper in our views than change our opinions, especially if the topic at hand relates to political affiliation.</p>

            <p>In addition to web development and story writing, our personalized story uses Arria Studio, a natural language generator, to produce text based on characteristics users provide and the data that complements them. Given data, Arria will integrate the data into the story and provides various functions to make the text read seamlessly.</p>
